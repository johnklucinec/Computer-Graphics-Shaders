# üé® CS 457 - Computer Graphics Shaders (GLSL)

Welcome to my showcase of projects Oregon State University's Computer Graphics Shaders course!

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please refer to the [glman](./glman) directory if you would like to try out the shaders.

## üöÄ Project Showcase
Each project folder contains:
  * Descriptions of my approach and implementation
  * Images showcasing each shader
  * Video demonstrations showcasing the final results
  * All files that I added or edited

> [!NOTE]
> Videos and write-ups include commentary originally intended for instructors.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
  * glman
  * GLSL Shaders (Vertex, Fragment, Geometry)

## üéì Core Skills & Project Highlights
  * Advanced graphics pipeline implementation
  * Lighting & visual effects:
    - Phong illumination, shadows, reflections, refractions
    - Parallax/displacement mapping, bump mapping
  * Procedural texturing:
    - Positional/gradient noise, Fractional Brownian Motion (FBM)
    - Smooth/step boundaries, texture-based data encoding
  * Shader development expertise:
    - GLSL (Vertex, Fragment, Geometry, Tessellation, Compute)
    - Real-time animations & non-linear transformations
  * Applied visualization techniques:
    - Opacity/color theory applications
    - Texture manipulation for enhanced visual fidelity
